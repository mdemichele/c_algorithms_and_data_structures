## Binary Search Steps 
1. Look at the middle value of the array.
2. If the middle value is the one you're looking for, you're done!
3. If the middle value is too big, then eliminate all values to the right.
4. If the middle value is too small, then eliminate all values to the left. 
5. Among the remaining values, locate the middle value and repeat.

## Note
Binary Search generally only applies if the array is already sorted.
