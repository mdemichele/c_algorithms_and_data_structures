## Heap Sort Algorithm

# What is a heap?
A heap is an array that can be visualized as an ordered binary tree. In a heap, each node is going to be either larger than both of its children or smaller than both of its children. If each node is larger, the heap is referred to as a max heap. If it's smaller, it's referred to as a min heap.
