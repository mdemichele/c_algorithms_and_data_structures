## Tree Traversals

First off, it's important to establish that, by tree traversal, we simply refer to the process of visiting each node in a data structure exactly once. Traversals are classified by the order in which this process is accomplished. There are typically two categories of traversals: *depth-first search* and *breadth-first search*. There are also various other more complicated types of traversals.

### Depth-first search
Depth-first Searches (DFS) are classified as such because the tree is searched as deeply as possible on each child before going to the next sibling
1. Pre-order (NLR)
2. In-order (LNR)
3. Reverse in-order (RNL)
4. Post-order (LRN)

### Breadth-first search 
Breadth-first searches (BFS) traverse trees in *level-order*, in which every node on a specific level are visited before going to the next lower level. As opposed to DFS methods, the tree is searched as broadly as possible on each depth before going to the next depth.
