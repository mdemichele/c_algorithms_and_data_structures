# C
Algorithms and interesting programs built in C. The goal of the project is simply to build some easy C implementations of well-known algorithms and data structures. 

Each algorithm or data structure will have a README file attached, explaining how the algorithm/data structure works and some psuedocode explaining each step. The README will also try to provide links to other helpful resources.
